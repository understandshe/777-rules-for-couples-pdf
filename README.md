# 777 rules for couples pdf: Why we almost died over separate pizzas

> "We were so busy being married, we forgot to be together." This is the raw story of how the **777 rules for marriage** saved us from becoming another divorce statistic.

### The Parallel Pizza Phase
It was a Tuesday. I remember bc Tuesdays are trash days and also the day my husband forgot we were married.

Not forgot forgot. Just... stopped seeing me. I was the woman who loaded the dishwasher. Who reminded him about his mom's birthday. Who sat on the other side of the couch scrolling while he watched videos about fish tanks. For three hours. On a Tuesday.

We hadnt fought. No big drama. Just this slow fade into roommates who shared a bathroom and occasionally ordered pizza.

The pizza was the breaking point. I wanted pepperoni. He wanted veggie. We got separate pizzas. Ate them in separate rooms. And I sat there with my greasy box thinking - this is it. This is how marriages die. Not with cheating or screaming. With parallel pizza consumption.

### The Rule That Saved Us from Becoming a Statistic
My sister told me about it. Some **777 rules for couples** thing her therapist mentioned. Sounded like corporate BS tbh. Like those team-building exercises where you fall backward and hope someone catches you.

But we were desperate. So we tried.

First week was awkward. Like dating your own husband. We went to that Italian place we used to love before kids, before the fade. Sat across from each other. I didnt know what to say that wasnt about the kids or the leaking faucet.

Then he asked about my job. Like, really asked. Not "how was work" while checking his phone. But "that project you were stressed about - did it get better?" And I cried. In the restaurant. Over breadsticks. Bc he still knew. Under all the pizza boxes and laundry piles, he still knew what mattered to me.

### What 777 Actually Means When You're Drowning
Look, the **777 rules for marriage** sound fancy. But its just math for people who forgot how to love on purpose.

**Every 7 Days: A Date.** Not "we're both home watching Netflix." Actual pants with buttons, out of the house, looking at each other's faces date. Even if you're broke. Even if you're tired. Even if youd rather die than put on real pants.

**Every 7 Weeks: A Night Away.** We couldnt afford a hotel at first. So we swapped houses with my sister. Sent the kids there, stayed in her empty apartment with her cat who hates us. Best night of that year. Bc we were somewhere that didnt have our life smeared all over it.

**Every 7 Months: The Big One. Vacation.** We saved for a year for our first one. Drove six hours to a cabin with no wifi. Fought about directions for two of those hours. Then sat on a porch watching fireflies and remembered why we picked each other in the first place.

### The Thing Nobody Tells You About Rules
Some people say this kills spontaneity. That love should be natural. Effortless. Those people arent married to my husband. Or maybe anyone.

Love IS work. Not hard work. But intentional work. Like watering a plant. You dont wait until its dying and then flood it. You do a little bit, consistently, bc you want it to live.

The **777 rules for dating** - or marriage, or whatever you're in - they're just a watering schedule. Bc left alone, we forget. The world fills up the space. Kids, jobs, the endless scroll of nothing that eats your evening.

### When the Rule Isnt Enough
I gotta say this part. Bc I read about that actor - Andrew something? Who cheated even with the rule? His wife gave him the **777 rules pdf** like a contract. Like "do this or else."

Rules dont fix broken. They maintain what's still alive. If someone already checked out, already betrayed, already decided you're not enough - then no schedule, no vacation, no magic number fixes that. We were lucky. We caught it early. The pizza was a warning, not an ending.

### The Real 777 Rule Presentation
I made my husband a slideshow once. Yes, really. Powerpoint and everything. "777 Rules: Why We Need This Or We'll Die." Very romantic. He laughed for ten minutes. Then he listened.

Bc here's what I learned: men dont always know how to say "I'm scared we're losing this." They just retreat. Into work, into hobbies, into fish tank videos. Not bc they dont care. Bc they dont know how to care out loud.

The rule gives them language. "Its been seven weeks, we need our night." Not "we need to talk" - which every man hears as "you failed." Just... a plan. A thing to do. An action to take.

### 777 Rule Parenting? Yeah, That Too
We tried it with the kids. Every 7 days: one-on-one time with each. Every 7 weeks: family adventure day. Every 7 months: big trip. They hated it at first. "Why do we have to hang out?" Now they ask for it. Bc kids feel the fade too. They just cant name it.

### The Manifestation Part I Didnt Expect
There's this **777 rule manifestation** thing. Write your desire 7 times, morning and night, for 7 days. Sounds woo-woo. I did it anyway. Wrote: "I want to feel close to him again."

And the weirdest thing happened. I started noticing him. Not the husband-shaped object in my kitchen. But him. I manifested by paying attention. By remembering what I wanted. By writing it until it became real again.

### Why I'm Telling You This
Bc last week was our 7-day date. Nothing fancy. Walked to get ice cream. Sat on a bench. He got chocolate on his shirt like always. I laughed like I used to. And I thought about that Tuesday. The separate pizzas. The almost-gone.

We're not perfect now. We still fight about the thermostat. But we're not strangers anymore. We're choosing each other. Every 7 days, every 7 weeks, every 7 months. On purpose. With intention. Like the **777 rules of marriage** say - or dating, or whatever you're building.

Love isnt luck. Its not magic. Its just... showing up. Again and again. Until the showing up becomes the love itself.

**What rule - or lack of one - almost ended your relationship? Tell me below. And go hug your person. Even if they have pizza breath.**
